# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

**For contributors**: If your PR includes changes to the `react-http-renderer` package, please run `pnpm changeset` and
follow the prompts to describe your changes. Commit the generated changeset file along with your code changes.
